pxnBackroomsLite - Backrooms world generator for minecraft (level 0)


This is the Lite version of a much larger plugin pxnBackrooms. The full plugin has 16 different levels and adding more. It's a big project with a lot to do, so here's a lite version of the plugin. This pxnBackroomsLite plugin contains only level 0 the lobby, no other levels or mechanics of the full plugin are included.

To use this world generator, just edit your multiverse worlds.yml file and set generator: pxnBackroomsLite

After setting the generator for the world, you may need to delete the files in backrooms/region/ if any vanilla chunks have already been generated.
